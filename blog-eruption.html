      The first time I saw an eruption from the air, I was speechless. The glowing red lava, thick clouds of smoke,
      and the surreal contrast between fire and ice made it feel like I had left Earth entirely. Flying above the
      Reykjanes Peninsula, I had a front-row seat to nature’s rawest power.

      As a pilot, I’m always looking down at Iceland’s rugged terrain — but this time, it was alive. The ground trembled below
      and the air smelled faintly of sulfur, even in the cockpit. Seeing the lava carve new paths across ancient rock reminded
      me of just how dynamic this island is.
    </p>

    <p>
      I circled the area for about 20 minutes, capturing photos and trying not to let awe get in the way of a safe flight.
      The views were hypnotic — rivers of lava glowing against the twilight. It’s one thing to see pictures; it’s another
      to feel the heat and motion from above.
    </p>

    <p>
      That flight changed the way I see Iceland. Since then, I've made it a mission to document eruptions, glaciers,
      and landscapes from above — and to share that perspective with the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're planning a trip to Iceland, I hope this blog helps you understand the power and beauty that lies just
      beneath the surface. And if you're lucky, maybe you'll catch a glimpse of the island breathing fire.
